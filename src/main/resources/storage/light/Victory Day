Victory Day
Every year on the ninth of May all the people in our country celebrate Victory Day. The 9th of May was the final day of the Great Patriotic War. It was in 1945. That war began on the twenty- second of June 1941. People from Belarus, Russia, the Ukraine and other countries fought against nazis. England, the USA, France and Poland took part in that war, too. Many people were killed.

There are many monuments and Victory memorials in our country. Every year in spring we put flowers to the monuments to honour the memory of the war heroes. We congratulate war veterans and give them flowers, too.
