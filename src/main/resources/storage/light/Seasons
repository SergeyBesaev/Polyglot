Seasons
There are four seasons in a year. They are winter, spring, summer and autumn. There are three months in each season. December, January and February are winter months. March, April and May are spring months. Summer months are June, July and August. Then Autumn months come: September, October and November.

Winter is the coldest season of the year. Summer is the warmest season. Spring is warmer than winter but it is colder than summer. Autumn is also colder than summer but it is warmer than winter.

Every season has its own charm and is good in its own way. There is much snow in winter. It often snows. I like to ski, skate and sledge in winter. In spring we enjoy the first grass, green leaves and the first flowers. The sun shines brighter and the days become longer. Summer is the hottest season when there are a lot of fruit, berries and vegetables. Schoolchildren have their longest holidays. It's my favourite season. I like to swim, lie in the sun, play outdoors in summer. The weather is usually fine. Sometimes it rains. But the rains are usually warm.

Autumn comes after summer. It brings rains and cold weather. But it's a tasty and beautiful season. Because there are a lot of fruits in autumn: apples, pears, grapes, plums, watermelons and melons. The leaves are red, green and yellow and they fall down from the trees. On the 1st of September we go to school. A school year begins.

I think all seasons are beautiful.
